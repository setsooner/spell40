## Intro
hello! spell40 is a 40% keyboard with a layout reminiscent of the W1-AT. It was designed by me and my friend binb0y of mkh. The board utlizes tadpole + gummy oring mounts, and a 6.2deg typing angle. The engravings (and general design, to an extent) are inspired by konosuba! character megumin. The layout is inspired by both the W1-AT, as well as the mkh studio bully. We took the numpad and xt from the W1 and attached it to the 13.5u width of the bully, with completely different bottom row support. The board should be compatible with the majority of base kits, given it includes the numpad. 

As of time of writing, prototype 1 has been received, and faults in the design have been found and remedied. A second prototype run is in the works. Hotswap pcb is basically done, but I will not be posting it until I've verified it works.

## Required Components
* Daughterboard
  * spell is designed to use any C series daughterboard, but the 3D model of [this](https://github.com/Unified-Daughterboard/UDB-C-JSH) was what I used while modeling.
* Mounting
  * spell mounts with either 9 GEON tadpoles, or with an o-ring. O-ring specs are 3.5mm CS x 200m ID. O-ring has yet to be tested, but it should fit by my calculations. 
  * [Tadpoles](https://geon.works/products/tadpole)
  * [Where we're getting our o-ring](https://www.polymax.co.uk/o-rings/rubber-silicone-o-rings/)
* Screws
  * Case screws are M3x8mm, daughterboard screws are M2x4mm.
* PCB
  * TODO: put text here.
* Case Feet
  * spell uses [SKUF feet](https://github.com/Zambumon/SKUF).

## Special Thanks 
While I say me and binb0y designed this, it took a lot of help from the community to get here. I'd like to extend my thanks to chill for his invaluable PCB advice. zhol and paaradiso of mkh for general design advice for everything from pcbs to the specifics of bottom case engravings. GEON for some pointers on mounting point placement. Cute for making amazing renders, and everyone else in MechKeys who contributed their opinions and for dealing with our constant pestering over the 1.5 years it took for the project to get here.
